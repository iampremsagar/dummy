# Zepto Support Assistant - Module 3

## Overview
The Support Assistant is a complete GenAI service designed to answer policy-related questions grounded in Zepto's official documentation. It implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline orchestrated by LangGraph and served via FastAPI.

## Architecture Description

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Ingestion**: Eight policy documents (`doc_01.txt` to `doc_08.txt`) are loaded into the system via the `populate_db()` function.
2. **Embedding**: Each document is embedded using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (via the `minilm_ef` embedding function) from the `sentence-transformers` library, ensuring efficient semantic representation. Chunking is handled as one chunk per document.
3. **Indexing**: Embeddings are stored in a **ChromaDB** collection named `company_docs` for high-performance cosine similarity search.
4. **Routing (LangGraph)**:
   - The `classify_intent` node determines if a query is a `policy_question` (requires retrieval) or a `general_question` (direct answer).
   - A conditional edge routes the flow to either `retrieve_and_answer` or `direct_answer`.
5. **Retrieval**: For policy questions, the `retrieve_and_answer` node retrieves the top 3 most relevant chunks from ChromaDB.
6. **Generation**:
   - **Mock Mode (Default, MOCK_LLM=1)**: Returns a deterministic, canned response: `"Based on the retrieved context: {snippet}"`.
   - **Real LLM Mode (Optional, MOCK_LLM=0)**: Runs a simulated LLM stub (validate-and-retry demo) using a structured role-context-task-format-length template defined in `PROMPT_TEMPLATE`.

### Data Flow:
`User Query` $\rightarrow$ `classify_intent` $\rightarrow$ (`retrieve_and_answer` $\rightarrow$ `ChromaDB`) OR (`direct_answer`) $\rightarrow$ `Pydantic Response Model` $\rightarrow$ `FastAPI /ask endpoint`.

### MOCK_LLM Toggle:
- **Default (1)**: Fully offline and deterministic. Intent classification (`classify_intent`) and direct answers (`direct_answer`) are always keyword or static-based. Answers for policy questions are templated. No network calls are made.
- **Extension (0)**: Runs a simulated stub in the `retrieve_and_answer` node that demonstrates the validate-and-retry loop; no external LLM is called. Note: Intent classification remains keyword-based in this implementation.

## Implementation Details
- **Structured Output**: Enforces a JSON schema via Pydantic with fields for `answer`, `sources` (list of doc IDs), and `confidence` (float).
- **API Wrapper**: A FastAPI application provides a `POST /ask` endpoint.
- **Containerization**: Includes a `Dockerfile` that builds a locally runnable image serving the assistant on port 7860.

## Local Setup & Deployment

### Run Locally
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start the server: `python main.py`
3. The API will be available at `http://localhost:7860/ask`.

### Run via Docker
1. Build the image: `docker build -t zepto-assistant .`
2. Run the container: `docker run -p 7860:7860 zepto-assistant`

### Project Structure
The assistant is located in the `/support_assistant` directory. The requirements are specified in `support_assistant/requirements.txt` and the policy documents are located in `support_assistant/docs/`.
